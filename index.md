*This website contains information regarding the paper Tackling covariate shift with node-based Bayesian neural networks.*

Node-based Bayesian neural networks (node-BNNs) have demonstrated good generalization under input corruptions.

In this work, we provide insights into the robustness of node-BNNs under corruptions and propose a simple method to further improve this robustness.
